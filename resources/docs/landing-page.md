In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Australian newspapers were a miscellany of content. They contained everything from local news and global reporting to advertising, timetables, new inventions and fiction. Newspapers and periodicals were, in fact, the main source of fiction for Australian readers for much of that time, and famous writers rubbed shoulders with unknown authors in the pages of your local newspaper.

Until recently, thousands of works of fiction were locked away in archives and little was known about the fiction published in the nation’s newspapers. Now for the first time, we can explore this fiction through *To Be Continued: The Australian Newspaper Fiction Database*, an interactive database of works of fiction sourced from the National Library of Australia’s Trove collection of digitised newspapers. 

There are more than 40,000 stories listed in the database. Some of these stories have not been read since they were first printed, whilst others have gone on to be world-famous works of literature.  As a result of this project, new authors have been identified and new works from existing authors been discovered in both short story format and as full-length novels serialised over the space of months and even years.

This vast new collection of fiction enables important new insights into the development of Australian literary, publishing and reading culture, including what early Australians were reading, where their fiction came from and how it was published and understood. 

But the database is not just for scholars to research. Anyone interested in Australian newspapers and fiction can get involved, by browsing for new fiction, or helping to add, edit and amend works of fiction in the database.
