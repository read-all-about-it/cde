Please find below some of the most frequently asked questions by users
of To Be Continued: The Australian Newspaper Fiction Database.

## Who set up the database?

Katherine Bode and Carol Hetherington started harvesting fiction from
the National Library of Australia's Trove collection in 2013, and the
team has only grown since then. You can find out more about them and the
rest of the team on the About Us page.

## Who is the database for?

The database can be used by anyone who has an interest in newspapers and
fiction, from academics to the general public. Find out more about the
database here.

## What is the database for?

To Be Continued can be used for your research project, whether it's a
passion project, or for work, school or university. But you can also use
it to browse fiction and find something new to read, whether you're
interested in a specific author, topic, time period or title, including
some that might not be in print now.

## Where does all this fiction come from?

All the fiction published in *To Be Continued* has been sourced from the
National Library of Australia's Trove collection of digitised
newspapers. The secret to the development of *To Be Continued* was using
the search box (and Trove's API) in a slightly different way. The
obvious approach would be to enter a story title or author's name. But
that strategy has its problems. It would take a long time to search
Trove using all known fictional titles and authors; it would only find
the stories and authors we expected to discover; and it wouldn't capture
fiction where the title has been changed or, much more commonly, where
the author's name is not given - anonymous and pseudonymous publication
was common in this period.

To overcome these issues, we searched Trove using words that commonly
introduce and surround newspaper fiction: \'serial\', \'story\', \'our
author\', \'tales and sketches\', \'our novelist\' and, most
successfully, \'chapter\' (this term commonly appears in the first four
lines of newspaper fiction and then, again, throughout the article,
meaning it is returned to the top of the list of relevant results).
There\'s more work to do once these results are exported, such as
grouping installments of the same story and working out who anonymous
authors might be, but that is where we got, and continue to get, fiction
from Australian newspapers.

## How can I get involved?

Anyone can get involved with editing and adding to fiction in the *To Be
Continued* database. If you find a chapter from an existing story in
Trove that is not included in To Be Continued you can add it. You can
also add an entirely new publication if you find a story in Trove that
is not listed in *To Be Continued* . Trove allows you to edit the text
versions of these stories to make it more readable and accessible to
others, and you can update To Be Continued so that it includes the newly
edited text. In *To Be Continued*, you can also add newspapers and
authors. But first you will need to sign up for an account.

## Can I edit the text?

Users can correct the text as they read along and then draw the
corrected version back into the database by clicking on the "Update text
from Trove" button in each chapter record.

With this database you can be the first modern-day Australian not only
to read but to edit a previously forgotten story, from Australia or
around the world. You can even export the story when you've finished and
publish it on Project Gutenberg to achieve your own first edition!

Another feature of To Be Continued is that it allows users to add
missing installments when they come across them in Trove, or to add
entirely new stories discovered in Trove's digitised newspapers. All of
these activities serve to improve and enrich our understanding of
Australian literature and literature in Australia.

## Can I add a new article I've found?

Yes you can. Once you have logged in, click 'Create Title'. You have to
fill in all the fields including Newspaper, Publication Title,
Publication Author, Common title, Length and Author.

Once you click Create, you will have to also add a first chapter (or
just the article if it is a short story completed in one edition of a
newspaper).

## What does Common Title mean?

Common Title means the most commonly used title for the story in the
database - the one that is listed the most if there are other editions
of the same story in other newspapers.

For example, if your story is called *The House of Silence* in the
newspaper you have found, but you have spotted that it is called *The
House of Silence;* *or, A Million Dollar Diamond : A Tale of New
Orleans* elsewhere, then the Common Title is the one that is used most
commonly in the other entries in To Be Continued. Sometimes this can be
a shortened or a longer version of the title you have. You can put the
title that is given in the newspaper in the Publication Title field.

## Can I add a new author?

Yes you can. Make sure to double check that you can't find the author in
the drop-down options, and if not, click "Please add here". It will ask
you for nationality, gender and so on - so add those if you know them.

## Why do I have to add the author twice?

Sometimes newspapers editors did not include the author in their edition
of the story. This could be for lots of reasons, such as space or
copyright.

If you have spotted other editions of the same story in *To Be
Continued* that have an author listed, but your version does not, type
'Unattributed' in the Publication Author, and then find the author
listed elsewhere in the 'Author' drop-down menu. If you cannot find an
author at all, even in other editions of the story, then list it as
'Unknown' in the author drop-down menu.

## Can I add a new newspaper title?

Absolutely. Make sure you double and triple check that you can't find
the newspaper in the drop-down menu first. Once you're sure, click the
link under the drop-down: "If you can\'t find newspaper in the list
please add them here."

Make sure to include the dates in the Newspaper title, as well as the
state, date range and any other details that is available in Trove in
the "View Title Info" link that drops down if you hover over the
newspaper title.

You cannot delete a newspaper once you have added it, but if you realise
you have added a newspaper that was already there please contact XYZ and
let us know so we can delete it in the system.

## How do I change an entry?

If you think you have made a mistake, then you can go back in and change
your entry. Find it again via the *To Be Continued* database search,
then click the link to the story under the Publication Title column.
Once you're in that entry, click 'View Title' and then 'Update' to make
changes.

## Can I delete an entry?

No, you cannot delete a story once you have added it to To Be Continued.
Please contact XYZ and let us know so we can delete it in the system.

How can I cite a story in the To Be Continued Database? (maybe just
wishful thinking but you never know)
