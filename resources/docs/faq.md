Please find below some of the most frequently asked questions by users of *To Be Continued: The Australian Newspaper Fiction Database*.

### Who set up the database?

Katherine Bode and Carol Hetherington started harvesting fiction from the National Library of Australia’s Trove collection in 2013, and the team has only grown since then. You can find out more about them and the rest of the team on the [About Us](/#/team) page. 

### Who is the database for?

The database can be used by anyone who has an interest in newspapers and fiction, from academics to the general public. Find out more about the database [here](/#/about).

### What is the database for?

*To Be Continued* can be used for your research project, whether it’s a passion project, or for work, school or university. But you can also use it to browse fiction and find something new to read, whether you’re interested in a specific author, topic, time period or title, including some that might not be in print now.

### Where does all this fiction come from?

All the fiction published in *To Be Continued* has been sourced from the National Library of Australia’s Trove collection of digitised newspapers. The secret to the development of *To Be Continued* was using the search box (and Trove’s API) in a slightly different way. The obvious approach would be to enter a story title or author’s name. But that strategy has its problems. It would take a long time to search Trove using all known fictional titles and authors; it would only find the stories and authors we expected to discover; and it wouldn’t capture fiction where the title has been changed or, much more commonly, where the author’s name is not given — anonymous and pseudonymous publication was common in this period.

To overcome these issues, we searched Trove using words that commonly introduce and surround newspaper fiction: 'serial', 'story', 'our author', 'tales and sketches', 'our novelist' and, most successfully, 'chapter' (this term commonly appears in the first four lines of newspaper fiction and then, again, throughout the article, meaning it is returned to the top of the list of relevant results). There's more work to do once these results are exported, such as grouping instalments of the same story and working out who anonymous authors might be, but that is where we got, and continue to get, fiction from Australian newspapers.

### How can I get involved?

Anyone can get involved with editing and adding to fiction in the *To Be Continued* database. If you find a chapter from an existing story in Trove that is not included in *To Be Continued* you can add it. You can also add an entirely new story if you find one in Trove that is not listed already in *To Be Continued*. Trove allows you to edit the text versions of these stories to make it more readable and accessible to others, and you can update *To Be Continued* so that it includes the newly edited text. In *To Be Continued*, you can also add newspapers and authors. But first you will need to [sign up for an account](/#/login).
