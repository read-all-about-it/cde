## What is *To Be Continued*?

Australia's newspapers have always published fiction, and lots of it.
But the huge size of the National Library of Australia's archives of
hard-copy newspapers meant that previously we had little idea of what
kind of stories were published, which authors were featured or where the
fiction came from.

It wasn't until the National Library of Australia began digitising its
archive of historical newspapers for the Trove database that we really
got an inkling of just how much fiction was printed in these pages. But
even then, this fiction was still hard to access, hidden among the
sometimes hundreds of articles which surrounded it in every edition of a
paper.

In 2013, literary historian Katherine Bode received Australian Research
Council funding to find fiction in digitised Australian newspapers. She
teamed up with bibliographer Carol Hetherington to identify the fiction
and separate it from the global and local news reporting, the
advertisements, inventions, timetables, poetry and letters which made up
the content of historical newspapers. Kath and Carol focused on fiction
in 19^th Century newspapers, and often their work involved linking
multiple instalments together, as stories could be published across many
months or even years of editions.

Their work was collected in [*To Be Continued: The Australian Newspaper Fiction Database*](https://cdhrdatasys.anu.edu.au/anfd/web/index.php?r=trove/search),
which went live to the public in 2018 with just over 20,000 publications
of fiction in Australian newspapers, including novels, novellas and
short stories, collated in one place.

Scholarly editor and cultural historian Roger Osborne joined the team in
2020 to help expand the project with a focus on 20th-century
publications. Supported by an Australian Research Council grant, the new
project, called "Read all about it", also investigates public
participation in literary curation and digital library collections and
creates digital infrastructure for Australian literary studies and the
National Library of Australia. 

Today, *To Be Continued* contains more than 40,000 publications of
fiction. But this work is not finished, and with your help, the database
can continue to grow.

## Fiction in the *To Be Continued* database

While Australian readers in the 19th and 20th centuries could buy or
order books from their local bookshop or library, their main source of
fiction on a daily and weekly basis was the newspaper.

Australian newspapers featured short stories and novellas as well as
full book-length novels, serialised in parts and chapters, which was a
way of telling stories in the mass media which was popularised by
Charles Dickens. People read each instalment as they came out in a form
of communal reading, and editors treated fiction like we might treat the
latest TV shows; with teasers and snippets and even advertisements in
other publications.

Australian newspapers featured a huge range of authors and genres from
around the globe. Scholars working on the database have identified
authors from Britain and America but also Austria, Canada, France,
Germany, Holland, Italy, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, Sweden and
beyond. You could find literary work in translation, such as excerpts
from Count Leo Tolstoy's [War and Peace](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article66177686), French
author Victor Hugo's [Ninety-Three: A Tale Founded on the French Revolution of 1793](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/162479976)
or tales such as [Buddha's Crystal](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/38680592)
from Japanese translator Yei Theodora Ozaki. The newspapers contained
works by prolific professional writers, aspiring authors submitting work
to literary competitions, and a huge number of pseudonymous and
anonymous authors too.

Importantly, *To Be Continued* has also highlighted the huge
contributions of Australian authors to newspaper fiction --- doubling
the number of known works of 19^th Century Australian novels. In the
pages of these newspapers, Australian authors got their first taste of
literary and critical success. Novels and short stories from Rosa Praed,
Henry Lawson, Marcus Clarke and Ernest Favenc shared pages with works
from celebrated international authors across the globe such as Mrs.
Georgie Sheldon, Richard Marsh, Mary Elizabeth Braddon and H. Rider
Haggard.

With *To Be Continued*, we're learning new things all the time about
what people used to read and how they read it, as well as debunking
myths about fiction publishing in newspapers. We used to think, for
instance, that newspaper fiction in Australia disappeared with the
emergence of cheap paperbacks at the end of the 19th century. But we now
know that this was not the case. Not only did Australian newspaper
fiction not die out, but in the 20th century it grew more prevalent, and
remained extensive until at least the 1940s.

The range of genres, styles and authors that editors printed in
newspapers was vast, and scholars and readers are only just beginning to
explore them. So the more fiction we have, the better understanding we
have of what Australians were reading in the 19^th and 20^th
centuries.

## Explore, edit and share: Getting involved with *To Be Continued*

The most important thing about *To Be Continued: The Australian Newspaper Fiction Database* is that it is interactive and crowdsourced.
Literary history has always been a participatory practice, and *To Be Continued* has drawn its participants from academics, librarians and
publishers to the broader community. Its openness allows more people to
explore and contribute to making Australian literary history, what it is
--- and can be --- today. You can get involved whether you're a scholar
or just interested in newspapers, Australian history and literature or
just love reading encountering new and diverse genres.

While we have been busy indexing, listing and creating the database,
finding ways to involve others in exploring and expanding *To Be Continued* is a big focus of the team. As well as public reading, the
database is open to community editing and curating --- and anyone can
get involved in improving and adding to its records. You can correct
errors in the digital text of the stories or identify instalments
missing from existing stories or adding entirely new publications to the
database. Find out how here.

It is also an amazing resource for scholars of all kinds. Anyone
interested in Australian publishing histories and fiction can download,
search and amend the database, and the data can be used for research
projects. We have scholars and readers identifying new writers, finding
out where this fiction came from by cross-referencing *To Be Continued*
with international databases and looking into topics such as Irish
bushrangers, bushfires, Australian gothic and ghost fiction, science
fiction and speculative writing, and Indigenous characters in Australian
fiction.

In 2023, *To Be Continued* will make another form of crowdsourcing
available, when it launches a collaborative digital editing platform.
People will be able to create, publish, and deposit their own 'ebooks'
made from the Australian newspaper fiction into the NLA's collections.

### A work in progress

It's important to remember that we are working with historical material.
Especially in the 19th and even into the 20th century, people had very
different values to what we have today and this means that sometimes the
things people wrote and published in their newspapers would not be
acceptable by today's standards. It's just something to be aware of when
you're searching and reading historic sources.

While the team have worked hard to make sure everything is up to date,
working with archival material, even when it is digitised, means that
there are missing editions of newspapers, ripped and torn pages, coffee
mug imprints and other issues which might impact the reading of a
historical newspaper. Some editors were not as scrupulous as we might
like, so there are misprints and misspellings; often, no author is
listed and sometimes editors even changed the title halfway through the
story or mixed up the order of chapters.

In addition, while the National Library of Australia's collection is the
largest of its kind in the world, it is still not complete. There are
lots of newspapers that haven't been digitised and are still only
accessible in hard copy. There are some editions that have been lost
altogether over more than 200 years of newspaper publishing in
Australia, starting from the *Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser* in 1803. So the database might not have everything and we
recommend doing your own research outside of *To Be Continued*, and if
what you find is in Trove, we'd love you to add it.
